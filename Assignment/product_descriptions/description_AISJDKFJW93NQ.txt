iPhone 17 has a 48MP Fusion Main camera with a 2x optical-quality telephoto and a 48MP Fusion Ultra Wide camera with 4x the resolution of the Ultra Wide camera on iPhone 16. And now, Ultra Wide photos are 24MP by default, the perfect file size for high‑quality storing and sharing. So you’ll get stunning, super-high-resolution shots — up close or far away, indoors and out, in conditions that go from bright to low light. And at 256GB, it has double the starting storage of the previous model.5 So you can capture to your heart’s content — and beyond.
